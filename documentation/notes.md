# Laravel Fortify and Sanctum
- So, I was able to check that fortify works just fine without sanctum
- My next question is, how do I set up my routes to be protected by sanctum for mobile?
- How do I know if the request is token-based or seesion based?
- How do I ensure that only mobile access can have access to the api? (I could check for a mobile device to guarantee)
